# SMART-ATTENDANCE-USING-PYTHON-OPENCV--EYESPARK
EYESPARK is an automated IoT attendance system. It pairs a deep-sleep ESP32-CAM client for image capture with a Python server for face recognition. The system logs attendance (On-Time/Late, no duplicates), identifies absentees, and sends comprehensive Telegram reports, automating traditional attendance management.
